## Zot Cookie Clicker
Users click to earn zots. Using zots, users can purchase upgrades to increase their Zots per Second rate. 
The higher the user's Zots per Second, the more upgrades become available to the user, allowing the user to progress through the game faster.

User's must also maintain their zot belly. Peter the Anteater can only zot if he has belly. If Peter's belly is empty, he can't zot. Users will have to purchase belly to maintain their zots.
