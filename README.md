# ZotClicker
This project was made for HackUCI 2018.
## Zot Cookie Clicker
Users click to earn zots. Using zots, users can purchase upgrades to increase their Zots per Second rate. 
The higher the user's Zots per Second, the more upgrades become available to the user, allowing the user to progress through the game faster.

The Zot Multiplier is available to be purchased with zots. Each time the zot multiplier is bought, the number of zots gained per click is increased. As the user progresses through the game, the zot multiplier will become more expensive to purchase.

User's must also maintain their zot belly. Peter the Anteater can only zot if he has food in his belly. If Peter's belly is empty, he can't zot. Users will have to purchase belly to maintain their zots. 

Users can use the keys 'z', 'x', and 'c' to click for zots. This makes it easier for users to earn zots and not just be limited to clicking with just one mouse.

### Technology
ZotClicker was built in Python, and primarily uses the Pygame library.
The build folder contains a executable version for Windows users.


#### Disclaimer
No zots were harmed in the making of this game.
